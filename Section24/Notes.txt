Nodejs
1. globalThis === window
    A. globalThis works outside of the browser as well
    B. window is part of the browser
    C. unified variables across different platform/system 

2. export/import works on node version 12 or above
3. three types of module 
    A. const c = required('./script.js)
    B. const c = required('fs')


Express
1. checks line by line
2. put = updating

Restful API
1. follows the rules and everyone can agreed upon 
2. get -receive resource
3. post - create a resource
4. put - update 
5. stateless - calls can be made independently of one another, and each call contains all the data neccessary to complete itself successfully

types of requests
1. req.query 
    - what we get when we use get 
2. req.body
    - bodyparser middleware
3. req.headers
4. req.params
    - use the parameter of the URL

FS
1. if no encoding is specified, then the raw buffer is returned

const fs = require('fs'); //fs = filesystem

fs.readFile('./hello.txt', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log('errrr');
    }
    console.log(data)
})

1. readFile is asynchronous 
    A. that's why it has callback function

2. readFileSync is synchronous
    A. don't do anything just wait here, until im done ill assign it and you can keep going 

usually we would use readFile so we won't block the execution
