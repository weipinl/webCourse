1. variable has to start with a letter and cannot be number or symbols (other than $ or _)
2. javascript uses camel casing
3. prompt() - return whatever you type
4. put <script> tag in body so the website would load first before execute any js files
5. some functions creates new list, some would just change it 

//function declaration 
function newFunction() {

}

//function expression
var newFunction = function() {

};  //function expression ends with semicolon

//expression
1+3;
var a = 2;
return 2;

//while loop vs do while loop
while loop checks the condition first vs do while do it first then checks the condition
