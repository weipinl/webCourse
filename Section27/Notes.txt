Node environmental variable 
- process.env.PORT 
    to set a specific port. ex #{process.env.PORT}.
        example:
            const PORT = process.env.PORT
            app.listen(PORT, () => {
                console.log('Server is listening to port ${PORT}')
            })
    we would have to inject it first in the following way
    Bash example :
         PORT=3000 node server.js
